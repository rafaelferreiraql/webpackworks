  p Webpack is a versatile module bundler, which not only lets you bundle all your Javascript in one single file, but also lets you work with the code provided by you and perform varied tasks with it through loaders and plugins. In this example, there's no Javascript to bundle, but Webpack is instead employed into building the HTML and the CSS those pages use through tools that, under the hood, are essentially Javascript.
  p Webpack is made for use with #[a(href="http://nodejs.org") Node.js].
